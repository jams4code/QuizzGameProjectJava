# QuizzGameProjectJava
Quiz game project for learning purpose written in Java

# Get started
- Clone the repo
- Start in Netbeans
- There is an automatic dataseed and it will use the in-memory database by default.

It's an old project so I don't commit new feature or refactor the code. I put it here in gitHub because I switched all my project from BitBucket to GitHub.
